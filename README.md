# MovieBacklog
This project is a site for keeping track of the movies and TV shows that I want to watch.

Technologies used:
* .Net
* RestAPI for quering IMDB databse
* PostgresDB

The project is currently running locally on my server but I'm planning to expose the aplication to used it outside my network
